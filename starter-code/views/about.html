    <h2>ABOUT</h2>
    <p>
      The Caped Crusader has been portrayed by more actors than any other
      superhero in movie history – eight to be exact. Most have lasted for just
      one film. But after The Dark Knight Rises, Christian Bale has become the
      first man to have played Bruce Wayne and his alter-ego more than twice on
      the silver screen. He didn’t have much competition – Michael Keaton was
      the only other actor to reprise the role at the time.
